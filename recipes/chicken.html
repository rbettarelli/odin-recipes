    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 skin-on, boneless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>preheat an air fryer to 400 degres F(200 degrees C)</p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>Pat chicken thighs dry with a paper towel and brush skins with olive oil. Place chicken thighs, skin-side down, in a single layer on a plate.</p> 
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Combine smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Sprinkle 1/2 of the seasoning mixture evenly over thighs. Turn thighs over and evenly sprinkle with remaining seasoning. Arrange thighs, skin-side up, in a single layer in the air fryer basket.</p>
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>Cook in the preheated air fryer until thighs are brown and the juices run clear, about 18 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</p>
